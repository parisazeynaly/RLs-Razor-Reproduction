# RL’s Razor: Reproduction Study  
*A complete reimplementation of “RL’s Razor: Why On-Policy Reinforcement Learning Forgets Less” (2025)*
# RL’s Razor: Reproduction and Extension Study

This repository contains a reproduction of the paper:

**RL’s Razor: Why On-Policy Reinforcement Learning Forgets Less (2025)**

The work reproduces the core experiments and evaluates whether the
KL–forgetting relationship generalizes to a different base model:
**Llama 3.2 1B Instruct**.

This project is structured for clarity, reproducibility, and step-by-step development.
